# ifood-mobile-test
Create an app that given an Twitter username it will list user's tweets. When I tap one of the tweets the app will visualy indicate if it's a happy, neutral or sad tweet.

## Business rules
* Happy Tweet: We want a vibrant yellow color on screen with a üòÉ emoji
* Neutral Tweet: We want a grey colour on screen with a üòê emoji
* Sad Tweet: We want a blue color on screen with a üòî emoji
* For the first release we will only support english language

### Hints
* You may use Twitter's oficial API (https://developer.twitter.com) to fetch user's tweets 
* Google's Natural Language API (https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) may help you with sentimental analysis.

## Non functional requirements
* As this app will be a worldwide success, it must be prepared to be fault tolerant, responsive and resilient.
* Use whatever language, tools and frameworks you feel comfortable to.
* Briefly elaborate on your solution, architecture details, choice of patterns and frameworks.
* Fork this repository and submit your code.

## Layout
This app is based on iOS 12 guide lines. There's a scene to list my friends and another scene to list the tweets of my friends. 

## Structure 
Based on Android Clean Architecure, thinking further having a standardized app in both platforms. It helps to avoid bugs on the same platforms, code maintenance and easy understanding for business rules on both platforms. 

Main 4 modules: Presentation, Domain, Store, Device (which one is not being used in this project).

#### Presentation
Evolves all the components related to the UI, animation and navigation. Can be used with any architecure of presentation:  MVC, MVP , MVVM, VIP, etc. All the screen are organized in scenes. For example, with MVP, each scene has: ViewController, Presenter, Configurator (for dependency injection).

#### Domain
Evolves all the entities or models and business rules. It's independent of platform, that means, in theory it should be portable to iOS, tvOS, watchOS and linux. The interactions are encapsulated in UseCases and each UseCase executes only one interaction.

#### Store
Evolves all the manipulations that evolves temporary data, cache or persistent data. 
The Store entrypoint are the repositories that has as function to determine the access data point, decide between DB and service for e.g. The access to the DB or services are implemented in DataSources.

#### Components
- Moya: REST wrapper upon Alamofire.
- TwitterKit: Provide an easy Twitter API consumption.
- Swinject: Dependency Injection.
- IQKeyboardManager: Helps keyboard to not cover textfields, searchBars and all.
- SnapKit: constraint builder for layout implementation via code. 
- RxSwift: Reactive framework to help in everything you can imagine.

#### Testing
No tests were implemented to this project 'cause lack of time üòî.
